    "# Griffin: Mixing Gated Linear Recurrences with Local Attention for Efficient Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Architecture\n",
    "All our models contain the following components: \n",
    "- (i) a residual block\n",
    "- (ii) an MLP block\n",
    "- (iii) a temporal-mixing block. \n",
    "\n",
    "While (i) and (ii) are the same across all models, we consider three temporal mixing blocks: global Multi-Query Attention (MQA), local (sliding-window) MQA and our proposed recurrent block. As part of the recurrent block we use the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU) â€“ a novel recurrent layer inspired by the Linear Recurrent Unit [Orvieto et al., 2023b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06349).\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual block, as shown in Figure 2(a), defines the global structure of our models and is inspired by pre-norm Transformers (Xiong et al., 2020). After embedding the input sequence we pass it through $N$ such blocks ($N$ denoting the model depth), and then we apply RMSNorm [Zhang and Sennrich, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467) to produce the final activations. To compute the token probabilities we apply a final linear layer followed by a softmax. The weights of this layer are shared with the input embedding layer."

    "\n",
    "Figure 2: a) The main backbone of our mode architecture is the residual block, which is stacked $N$ times. b) The gated MLP block that we use. c) The recurrent block that we propose as an alternative to Multi Query Attention (MQA). It uses our proposed RG-LRU layer, defined in Section 2.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual block contains two components, applied in order. The first component takes the hidden state $\\chi$ and applies an RMSNorm [Zhang and Sennrich, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467), followed by the temporal-mixing block. We then merge the output with a skip connection from $\\chi$ through addition. Similarly, the second component applies RMSNorm, followed by the MLP block and then merges its output with a skip connection from the input of the RMSNorm. This block is illustrated in Figure 2 (a)."
